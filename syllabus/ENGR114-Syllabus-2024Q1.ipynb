    "### Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework is intended as a means of practicing the concepts presented in class. It is advised that you keep up with your homework assignments each week and submit each week’s assignment to D2L. Homework will be reviewed by your instructor to determine which topics need more reinforcement and as a way for you and your instructor to share your course progress. Homework will not be included in your grades and homework due dates will not be enforced by grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, lecture is held early in the week, and lab is held later in the week. Lab assignments are typically due at the end of the lab period and uploaded to D2L. Lab assignments can be redone and re-submitted to improve your grade. All lab re-submissions must be uploaded to D2L by Monday at 9am, the last week of the quarter (the Monday before finals week). No labs submitted after this date will be evaluated for course credit. The lab redo due date ensures your instructor has time to grade your lab assignments before the end of the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exams\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two Exams in the course: one Midterm Exam and one Final Exam. If a student is unable to take the exam when it is scheduled, it is the student's responsibility to notify the instructor at least 1 week before the date of an exam. Make-up exams, if allowed, will be scheduled by the instructor after consulting with the student before the original date of the exam. I look forward to working with any students who have testing accommodations. It is the student's responsibility to set up a meeting at least 1 week before the exam date to review exam protocol.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Exam Deadlines and Grading:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Exams can be completed at any time during the week the exam is posted. You have one week to complete each exam after the exam is opened.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Exam uploads after the deadline posted in D2L will receive a 0 (insufficient evidence).\n",
    " \n",
    " * You can re-do your Exam 1. Exam 1 re-dos are due by the last week of the quarter, Monday at 9am. No Exam 1 redos will be accepted after this due date for a grade to give your instructor sufficient time to grade your Exam 1 re-dos by the end of the quarter.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Exams that contain copied work of others will receive a 0 (insufficient evidence). The instructor can not assess student learning when a student submits someone else's work. A student who receives a 0 (insufficient evidence) on Exam 1 must complete an Exam 1 re-do by the last week of the quarter, Monday at 9 am.\n",
    " \n",
    " * There are no Exam 2 redos. Exam 2 must be turned in by the due date posted on D2L to receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Class Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Most lecture days include in-class practice that should to be uploaded to D2L by the end of the class period. See D2L for specific in-class practice assignment details. In-class practice assignments will not be graded. Use in-class practice assignments to track your progress in the course and track your participation in the course. In-class assignments will not be included in your grades and in-class assignment due dates will not be enforced by grading."

Please note that D, F, P/NP, AUD grades do not meet prerequisite requirements and are not transferable to 4-year Oregon Engineering Colleges and Universities. An I (Incomplete) grade is reserved for students who have completed a majority of the course requirements and for reasons acceptable to the instructor, cannot complete the course. A written request, signed by the instructor and student, stating the reasons for the incomplete and a schedule for completing course requirements must be filed in the Engineering Office. Note that an I may impact financial aid. See PCC's Grading Guidelines: [https://www.pcc.edu/student-records/grading/](https://www.pcc.edu/student-records/grading/)"
